    <p class = "paragraph">Crisp and refreshing homemade iced tea is easy to make and easy to scale up for a crowd. This is always a hit at summer gatherings. Serve it with your favorite sweetener or enjoy it unsweetened.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2-1/4 cups water</li> 
      <li>6 regular-size tea bags (about 1/2-ounce total), or 2 family-size tea bags</li>
      <li>6 cups cold water</li>
      <li>Granulated sugar for garnish</li>
      <li>Lemon wedges for garnish</li>
      <li>Mint sprigs for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>In a small saucepan, bring the 2-1/4 cups water to a gentle boil. Add the tea bags, remove the saucepan from the heat, and cover. Steep for 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Remove the tea bags without squeezing them (which would add bitterness) and pour the steeped tea into a 2-1/2-quart heatproof container (like a large Pyrex liquid measure). Add the 6 cups cold water and mix. Let cool at room temperature and then refrigerate until cold. Serve over ice, garnished with sugar, lemon wedges, and mint sprigs.</li>
